# Blueprint: CHECKIT - Modern Health Service Website

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a complete redesign of the CHECKIT website, a service that assists foreigners with health check-ups in Korea. The new design focuses on a modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface, using a **deep mint color** as its primary branding element and a **card-based layout** for clear content separation.

Built with HTML, CSS, and a placeholder JavaScript file, the website is designed to be fully responsive and professional, creating a strong first impression for potential clients.

## 2. Core Features & Design

### **Visual Design**

*   **Color Palette:** The primary color is a deep mint (`#008080`), creating a professional and trustworthy feel. This is complemented by a light secondary color (`#f0f7f7`) and clean white backgrounds.
*   **Typography:** The `Poppins` font is used for its modern and clean aesthetic, enhancing readability.
*   **Card-Based Layout:** Services and Process sections are organized into distinct cards (`<div class="card">`). This modular design improves scannability and visual organization. Each card has a subtle shadow and a lift effect on hover, creating a sense of depth.
*   **Sticky Header:** The header is fixed to the top of the page, ensuring that navigation links and the primary call-to-action are always accessible.

### **Structural Enhancements**

*   **Hero Section:** A compelling hero section with a clear headline and a prominent call-to-action button (`.cta-button-primary`) to immediately engage users.
*   **Sectional Organization:** The content is logically divided into sections for Services, Process, and a Footer that also serves as a contact point.
*   **Footer as Contact:** The footer has been redesigned to be a clear and final call-to-action, encouraging users to get in touch via email.

## 3. File Structure

*   `index.html`: Contains the new semantic HTML structure, reflecting the updated, modern design.
*   `style.css`: A completely new stylesheet that implements the deep mint color scheme, card designs, responsive layout, and modern typography.
*   `script.js`: Currently an empty file to prevent console errors, but ready for future interactivity.
*   `blueprint.md`: This document, fully updated to describe the new design and structure.

## 4. Development Plan (Current)

This plan outlines the steps taken to implement the new design.

1.  **HTML Restructuring:** The `index.html` file was rewritten to create a more modern and semantic structure, with clear sections for hero, services, and process.
2.  **CSS Redesign:** The `style.css` file was completely replaced with new code that implements the deep mint color theme and the card-based design, using modern CSS properties like variables for easy theme management.
3.  **JavaScript Placeholder:** An empty `script.js` file was created to ensure the HTML links are valid and avoid browser errors.
4.  **Blueprint Update:** This `blueprint.md` document was updated to reflect the new design, features, and file structure.
