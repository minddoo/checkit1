# Blueprint: CHECKIT Website

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a simple, single-page informational website for CHECKIT, a service providing health check-up assistance for foreigners in Korea. The website is built with fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any external frameworks.

Its primary purpose is to introduce the services offered, explain the process, and provide a clear call-to-action for users to request a consultation.

## 2. Core Features & Design

### **Design & Layout**

*   **Clean & Simple Structure:** A straightforward, top-to-bottom layout divided into logical sections: Services, Process, Reviews, and Contact.
*   **Fixed Header:** A sticky header ensures that the navigation and language options are always accessible.
*   **Clear Call-to-Action:** A prominent "상담 신청하기" (Request Consultation) button is featured in the main hero section.

### **Functionality**

*   **Static Content:** The website is composed of static HTML content that clearly outlines the value proposition of the CHECKIT service.
*   **Basic Interactivity:** A JavaScript event listener is attached to the main call-to-action button (`#consultBtn`), which triggers a simple `alert` to confirm the user's action.
*   **Language Switcher (Placeholder):** The UI includes buttons for switching between Korean (KR), English (EN), Chinese (CN), and Vietnamese (VI), though the full functionality for this feature is not yet implemented.

## 3. File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the entire structure of the webpage.
*   `style.css`: A CSS file providing basic styling and layout rules.
*   `script.js`: A JavaScript file that handles the click event for the consultation button.
*   `blueprint.md`: This document, providing a comprehensive overview of the project.

## 4. Development Plan (Completed)

This section outlines the steps that were taken to create the current version of the website.

1.  **Project Reset:** The project directory was cleared of all previous files to start fresh.
2.  **HTML Scaffolding:** A new `index.html` file was created with the complete semantic structure for the site, based on the user-provided code.
3.  **CSS Styling:** A new `style.css` file was created to apply basic styling, including layout, fonts, and colors, as specified in the user's code.
4.  **JavaScript Implementation:** A new `script.js` file was created to add a simple `alert` function to the consultation button, as requested.
5.  **Blueprint Creation:** This `blueprint.md` file was generated to document the newly created website.
