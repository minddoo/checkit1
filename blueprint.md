# Blueprint: CHECKIT Website (English Version)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a simple, single-page informational website for CHECKIT, a service providing health check-up assistance for foreigners in Korea. The website is built with fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has been fully updated to an English version to cater to a global audience.

Its primary purpose is to introduce the services offered, explain the process, showcase user reviews, and provide clear calls-to-action for users to request a consultation.

## 2. Core Features & Design

### **Design & Layout**

*   **Clean & Simple Structure:** A straightforward, top-to-bottom layout divided into logical sections: Services, Process, Reviews, and Contact.
*   **Fixed Header:** A sticky header ensures that navigation and language options are always accessible.
*   **Detailed Content:** The English version includes more descriptive text in the hero section and more detailed user reviews to provide clearer information to a non-Korean audience.
*   **Dual Call-to-Action:** A second consultation button has been added to the final "Contact" section to maximize conversion opportunities.

### **Functionality**

*   **Static Content:** The website is composed of static HTML content in English.
*   **Interactive Buttons:** JavaScript event listeners are attached to both consultation buttons (`#consultBtn` and `#consultBtn2`), which trigger a confirmation `alert`.
*   **Language Switcher (Placeholder):** The UI includes buttons for switching between Korean (KR), English (EN), Chinese (CN), and Vietnamese (VI), though the full functionality for this feature is not yet implemented.

## 3. File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the entire structure of the webpage (in English).
*   `style.css`: A CSS file providing styling and layout rules, with minor updates for the English version.
*   `script.js`: A JavaScript file that handles click events for both consultation buttons.
*   `blueprint.md`: This document, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's current state.

## 4. Development Plan (Completed)

This section outlines the steps that were taken to update the website to the English version.

1.  **HTML Content Update:** The `index.html` file was overwritten with the new, English-language HTML code provided by the user.
2.  **CSS Style Update:** The `style.css` file was updated with new styles to better suit the English content and layout.
3.  **JavaScript Logic Update:** The `script.js` file was updated to include an event listener for the second consultation button (`#consultBtn2`).
4.  **Blueprint Update:** This `blueprint.md` file was updated to reflect the new English version of the website, including the updated features and content.
